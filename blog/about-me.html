    <p>My name is John Wirihana Aupouri .  I was born in Wellington, raised in Wairoa in the Hawke’s Bay. I’ve lived in New Zealand my whole life and the only place overseas I’ve been was the South Island where I lived from 18 to 21 in Nelson, Greymouth and Westport and out at sea as a fisherman where I worked. I’ve also lived in many different places around the country working in many different forests as a bushman from the age of 21 to 28.  For the last two years I’ve held many different jobs like orchid work to concreting.</p>
    <p> The last job I had that I left right before this course was supposed to be for two weeks cleaning up a motel where the manager had gone into debt for $60,000 and was, at the time, in jail because he was moon-lighting as a drug-dealer slash brothel-operator hard case alright.  Anyway, got the job through a friend who in-turn I found out later, got it from his mother-in-law which in hind-sight explains a lot.</p>
    <p> Well I ended up meeting this lady who I automatically presumed was the person I’d be calling boss.  We do the introduction thing and so on then she tells me she wants me to clean out a shed that was there.  Ok, well I get there and it’s just not on from the get go.  Firstly I could barely push the door open enough to get in.   Then when I did, it was like a giant game of tetris with that lady constantly making it difficult.</p>
    <p> Check it out, I’m carrying a table out to throw away, she see’s me, comes running across, slips over on the drive-way gravel where the trailer I was using was parked, jumps up like nothing happened and starts going on about how we can re-use some of the stuff or junk depending your point of view which was mine.  Again I say that’s a good idea, even though I didn’t think so, but I kindly reminded her why I was throwing it out, because it only had three legs.  She then reckons, and I quote “Maybe you will find some tools and you could fix some things”. I didn’t know what to say, because the shed was full of broken furniture and all kinds of things.</p>
    <p> It turns out clearing out the shed meant or metamorphosed into fix everything broken, which was everything. It was like one of those hoarders on TV you see who can’t get rid of anything.</p>
    <p> I tried telling her mended furniture was not a good look for the motel it seemed like common sense. I mean does a restaurant serve last nights left-overs?  Anyway out of nowhere she starts screaming “Stop hitting me!” I was shocked.  I tried to calm her down but she kept getting worse and ironically more creative with what she was shouting.  I promptly exited the shed while she was constantly trying to obstruct me by trying to block me like she was a goal-defence for the silver-ferns. I have to admit I had to push her out of the way but it was quite a surreal experience for me as you can imagine. Imagine yourself in a shed with a lady standing between you and the door screaming stop hitting me.</p>
    <p> Anyway it turns out a couple day’s later I find out that lady was not only the partner of the questionable manager, but his partner in crime.  She was a meth-addict. I believe I handled that particular occasion well, had a lot like that for the last two years since I left the forest & the sea, i’ve been feeling, i suppose how would you put it, um, I guess I don’t know actually.  I just recently turned 30 and I feel like I have to do something different.</p>
    <p> Currently I live with my Grandfather taking care of him or maybe it’s the other way round.  I’m entirely in the dark when it come’s to web-design but I’m hoping to change that.  I like to keep things simple from an ethical point of view, do unto others as you would have them do unto you, treat people how you want to be treated. I am also a firm believer of there is a time & place for everything. One of the things I've lived by is nothings above mockery including myself.</P>
    <p> Laughter heals the soul, true in my mind, my love of truth is value numero uno for me, for the simple reason that no one person can possess it or monopolise it, anything & everything can be thrown under the microscope, maybe not anywhere though? My greatest strength is auritory articulation for a resonable conflict resolution.</P>
