            <em>Neuroplasticity</em>         
              Neuroplasticity is the change in neural pathways and synapses that occurs due to certain factors, like behavior, environment, or neural processes. During such changes, the brain engages in synaptic pruning, deleting the neural connections that are no longer necessary or useful, and strengthening the necessary ones.
              There are two types of neuroplasticity, including: Functional plasticity: The brain's ability to move functions from a damaged area of the brain to other undamaged areas. Structural plasticity: The brain's ability to actually change its physical structure as a result of learning.

            <em>The Growth Mindset</em>
              The Growth Mindset is when people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment. The opposite of the Growth mindstate is the fixed mindstate. In a fixed mindset, people believe their basic qualities, like their intelligence or talent, are simply fixed traits.
              They spend their time documenting their intelligence or talent instead of developing them. They also believe that talent alone creates success without effort. They're wrong.
            </p>
          <em>A Fixed mindset believes attributes & abilities are inherently fixed & will not change no matter how much effort put in. The Growth mindset is the polar opposite</em>

              To me I feel these concepts constitute hope so therefore unless your willing to deny hope in the human experience the idea of Will comes in to play, also the growth vs fixed mindstate concept is one that I've contemplated long before joing Dev Academy or be it by another name. Duality can be found in all aspects of nature.
            </p>
            <p id="bottomText">
              I even believe parts of a fixed mindstate can be intergrated appropriately to help the Growth mindstate advance. Isn't a certain amount of stubborness a pre-requsite of determination & resilience when faced with adversity? I actually do think and choose to believe this. I would have already quit if that wasn't true. It's seems like if one's willing to keep an open mind then by definition they're in the Growth-Mindset.
