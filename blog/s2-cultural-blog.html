      <h2>Learning plan</h2>
    <p>
      To be perfectly honest the best thing I can say I have is the most invisible thing there is a good intention.
      With that being said in preparation I've been saving since initially meeting Jack last year.
      I bought a new Mac specifically to attend Dev and a new car so that I can move to Wellington for bootcamp.
      Currently I haven't made plans for accomodation but I gotta worry about s3 etc before bootcamp but in saying that I must harken back to my opening statement.
      I whole heartily intend for the next five years of my life working with code, beyond that I wouldn't dare to speculate at this point in time.
      Nobody has every accused my of asking for help lol, it's a condition I need to remedy no doubt thats also what was appealing about Dev to me.
      My word is my commitment yes but just like asking for help nobodies every accused my of striking them as being saintly either,
      though again I must harken back to my original statement but now I'll amend it to this, the only intention I have is not to waste mine or Dev's time.
      I understand this will be a tremendous undertaking on my part but am as of right now still fully committed to this endeavour.</p>
    <p>
      Hard to say what I expect from the tutors, I mean I just want everything to go well obviously, in my mind I come to you, my jobs to learn,
      their job is to facilitate that learning, best way I can put it. I mean I just want them to help me in the confidence department as I litterally feel 13 and not 30 here.
      Let's go with this flipped learning buzz, seems like a good idea lets give it a go anyway but sometimes I feel like I need some old fashioned instruction face to face.
      I do want to try and get into campus during foundations but it's a far trip and I just got the fibre optics installed for foundations.
      It would be better though if I could get in and get a feel for things but I need to get ahead time-wise on the sprints so I can make the trip.
      No luck in that department yet nor for the foreseeable duration of foundations more than likely will be working into the week break before bootcamp I hope not ,will try to but yeah.
      Conceptually I can see & kind of understand the methodology behind how & why the components fit & work together I generally think in terms of cause & effect.</p>
    <p>
      I just need to familiarise myself more with the format and in my experience that best comes with practical experience it reminds me of trying to memorise log-specification sheets,
      grades, lengths, attributes etc. Everything can be defined as a process. I've worked with, trained & been trained by various different personalities in various different industries & occupations.
      Some good, some bad, some unbelievable, some indescribable and some unconscionable but no matter what theres always a lesson to learn even in failure, maybe especially so trial & error.
      Of course I will seek help if I truly feel it's necessary but I don't mind people just watching and saying what they think without me asking for an opinion if they should so feel the need.
      I like to reflect on how intimidated I felt at the beginning of everything I am currently qualified to do. It reminds me that nobody knowâ€™s until they know, I couldn't cut a tree down before I could,
      I didn't think I'd be able to spend up to three months at a time out deep-sea fishing before I did. I've come to believe that simple & genuine enthusiasm  is the best recipe to undertake new challenges.
      In the end I guess it's a cliche, I know and I do so hate how platitudes are so often too easily mistook for wisdom but to iterate my point "I will get out what I put in".</p>
      During the Bootcamp I don't foresee any obligations that supersede successfully completing the course.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</strong> : I have a few thing's I have been, and intent to run simultaneously moving forward. I want to gain a new career in tech hopefully this year and next year my primary goal will be my physical health, mentally I feel strong but also combustible, a secondary issue I have been working on for the past 3 years and should be right by this time next coinciding with what has been a plan 3 years in the making.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</strong> : I've had regimental routines before just not in a long time but am looking forward to this immensely . I find being able to articulate precisely how I feel about something and plus I believe I'm quite intuitive already in aspects such as emotional E.Q in person though I'm better with others than I am with myself in terms of co-operation. I also belive I have a firm girp on the principle of cause and effect how I learnt my prior professions, I'm determined with a single focus to becoming a computer programmer. My short comings are, in an odd way a proclivty for single minded, single handed share determination, a kind of body on the line kind of attitude. Also My biggest challenge and the thing I will require the most help in is the logic.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</strong> : Asking for help.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</strong> : Patience. To me the sum of man's problem's come from his inability to sit alone quietly in a room. Those are not my word's and forgive me I can no longer remember where it came from but I have contemplated those words for a very long time as if it was an equatiion in desperate need of an answer.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</strong> : To help me become competent in computer programming emphasis on the logic.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</strong> : To aquire a new technical skill-set, so long as I finish Bootcamp feeling myself like I know what I'm doing.</p>
    <p>
      <strong>TACTICAL PLAN</strong> : During class I will try as hard as I can to keep pace with the peer programming but after 5pm & before 8.45am I will be trying to complete everything I have missed thus far and continually too. I intend to devote as much time as possible to Dev.</p>
