      <strong><em>A time I got stuck</em></strong>
    </h2>
      <p id="s4techparagraph">
        Well I pretty much get stuck constantly so where to begin. Here a silly mistake but important lesson. I was on Manipulating JavaScript Objects upto the Add a carson property to the value of the terah children property. carson should be an object with a property name with the value "Carson" done it but on the next one I mixed up the spelling with Carter and somehow I ended up thinking I hadn't passed the carson value.
        Long story short I spent a couple hour trying to pass something I had already passed and because I kept trying to pass the Carson property when I should have been doing the Carter property. I Don't know how I fixed I noticed it when I started reading carefully back over what I had done and what was being asked of me. The lesson here is pay attention to what your reading and typing.

      <strong><em>Problem solving techniques & process</em></strong>
    </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Pseudocode - It helped a lot to visualise what was happening but I couldn't always figure out how to start.
        </li>
        <li>
          Trying something - Been doing that my whole life.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rubber ducky method - Haven't checked it out yet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reading error messages - I now know a bit more on how to interperet I've found them to be a convenience directing me to what and where my code is wrong but sometimes I get ones that just baffle me.
        </li>
        <li>
          Console.logging - Quite handy.
        </li>

        <li>
          Googling - Sometime I find a diamond in the rought but mostly the sites I found they use differnt lingo to what I'm seeing on my screen.
        </li>
        <li>
          Asking your peers for help - Need to do that more but I wanted to try and do as much as I can so that I know for sure after foundations if this is for me.
          I believe so but I will be definately seeking help and advice at bootcamp plus alot of the time I don't quite know how to phrase what I want to know.
        </li>
        <li>
          *Asking coaches for help - That's a bit easiers they can usually see what's wrong without me having to say. Joseph's been great keeping me motivated
