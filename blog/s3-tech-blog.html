        <p>Html is like the foundations and frame of a house. The css determines wether its wall-paper or paint, the color and style of curtains, doors, windows etc.
        <img class="lefttop" src="images/html-css-js.png" alt="html,css,js logo" ALIGN="right"> Java acts as the eletrical system operating appliances, censor lights and automatic garage doors etc. HTML provides the basic structure of sites, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript. CSS is used to control presentation, formatting, and layout. JavaScript is used to control the behavior of different elements.
      </p>

      <div class="right"><p>"Control flow and arrays?"</p>
        <img class="righttop" src="images/java-array-example.gif" alt="A depiction of an array and how computers start counting at zero">
        <p>Flow of control through any given function is implemented with three basic types of control structures:</p>
          <ol class="control-list">
            <li>Sequential: default mode. Sequential execution of code statements (one line after another) -- like following a recipe.</li>
            <li>Selection: used for decisions, branching -- choosing between 2 or more alternative paths. In C++, these are the types of selection statements: 'if', 'if/else' and 'switch'.</li>
            <li>Repetition: used for looping, i.e. repeating a piece of code multiple times in a row. In C++, there are three types of loops: 'while', 'do/while' and 'for'.
            Computers start counting at zero or the zeroeth number, something to remember.</li>
          </ol>

      <div class="left1"><p>"Functions and why they are useful?"</p>
        <img src="images/e-function-math-function-mathematical-symbol-free-icon-math-function-example-in-java.jpg" alt="The function symbol">
        <p>Functions can be thought of as a block of code with a particular name designed to do a specific task.</p>
        <p>A function is something that can take one or more inputs and returns one or more values.</P>
        <p>For example, f(x) = x2 is a function that returns squared value of x</p>
        <p>If x = 2, then f(2) = 4</P>
        <p>If x = 3, then f(3) = 9 and so on.</p>
        <p>To me functions remind me of algerbraic equations and I hated math but here we are.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="right1"><p>"The DOM and DevTools + Loops & objects?"</p>
        <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard. The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents.</p>
        <p>A Java object is a combination of data and procedures working on the available data. An object has a state and behavior. The state of an object is stored in fields (variables), while methods (functions) display the object's behavior. Objects are created from templates known as classes.</p>
        <p>Loops in Java. Looping in programming languages is a feature which facilitates the execution of a set of instructions/functions repeatedly while some condition evaluates to true.</p>
        <p>Developer tools for me at least was a big help in allowing me to see what I was doing when I was doing it without having to continually save and open the html I'm working on.
